    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Females are mostly known for making sandwiches and lactating. One day, a couple of gals decided that they also wanted to be known for being funny. Despite what the media or your grandfather may tell you, women have always been witty. A couple of wide-eyed dreamers rounded up the funniest gals they knew, and in the Spring of 2011, "The Rib" was born. Against the odds, this team of semi-talented and semi-hilarious ladies gathered to form a female comedy writing group with the goal of showing Brown University what's up. </p>
    
    <p>After the girls had synchronized all of their cycles and participated in exactly 17 semi-nude pillow fights, they finally created a website in the summer of 2011 to publish their work.</p>

    <p>The Rib (coming as a reference to Adam's rib that made Eve, and also meaning "to joke") looks to bring funny, foxy females together on Brown's campus to explore what makes them laugh and share those laughs with only those who can afford internet.</p>
      
    <p>ENJOY.</p>
